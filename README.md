# Meteora
Meteora is a tweak to completly bring back the iOS 9 lockscreen to iOS 10+    
Currently it is a work in progress. Once this project is completed it will be released on BigBoss as a paid package.    
This tweak was mainly created by iKilledAppl3 but he open sourced it hoping someone would help fix the bugs. Skitty decided to help so iKilledAppl3 could release it. Most credit iKilledAppl3 to him for originally creating the tweak and figuring everything out.    

# Things to Do!
- Touch ID: Touch ID currently doesn't work at all. This is the biggest setback currently but we are working on a fix.
- Notifications: The Notifications are only half completed and still need to be finished.
- Fix more bugs: Yeah, there's lots more bugs we know.
